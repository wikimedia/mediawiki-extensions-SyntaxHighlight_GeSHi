Could we consider to use $language !\u003d\u003d \u0027\u0027 too?\n\nUpstream. This change breaks again the GeSHi upstream and extension equivalence, at the moment we were able to sync our codebase again (they published a new release solving the HTML5 issues). By the way, an upstream bug should be created (cf. bugzilla).",
